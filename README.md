# Electron-Server
The Electron Server is the REST API (core logic of the Electron app) that enables teachers and students to manage effective classes, attendance, assignments and exams.

It offers features for classes with dedicated rooms for each subject in the class timetable along with a dedicated class calendar where teachers can read/write updates about assignments and exams. Admin can create classrooms and virtual (Jisti) rooms for each subject. Each and every piece of information is stored in a database. The system provides API endpoints to fetch the data and to modify and update it. Admin can import and export event data in a standard compressed file format that includes the classroom data in JSON.
